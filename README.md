# multicolor DMD-SIM
This repository contains code for designing, analyzing, and carrying out multicolor structured illumination microscopy
experiments based on a digital micromirror device (DMD-SIM), including DMD simulation code, DMD pattern generation, SIM reconstruction and
instrument control. It also includes a number of useful utilities for simulating the resulting diffraction 
pattern given certain DMD patterns, determining system point-spread functions and optical transfer functions, and 
determining the affine transformation between the DMD coordinates and the imaging space coordinates. The various 
files are described in more detail below.
 
# Published work using this code
* This DMD simulation tools and SIM reconstruction code were originally created for our Biomedical Optics Express paper 
[Multicolor structured illumination microscopy and quantitative control of polychromatic light with a digital micromirror device](https://doi.org/10.1364/BOE.422703)
([preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.27.223941)). The repository state at the time of publication is archived [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4773865), or available as
a [release](https://github.com/QI2lab/mcSIM/releases/tag/v1.0.0) on GitHub.
* The SIM reconstruction code was also used in [Resolution doubling in light-sheet microscopy via oblique plane structured illumination ](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01635-8) 
([preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.19.492671)). This version is archived [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6419901) or available as a [release](https://github.com/QI2lab/mcSIM/releases/tag/v0.2.0)
* For a tutorial on SIM reconstruction, see our [I2K 2022 talks](https://github.com/QI2lab/I2K2022-SIM).

# Installation
The best way to use this python package is to install it with pip
```
git clone https://github.com/QI2lab/mcSIM.git
cd mcSIM
pip install .
```
If you would like to edit the code, then install using the `-e` options,
```
git clone https://github.com/QI2lab/mcSIM.git
cd mcSIM
pip install -e .
```
The dependencies for the experimental control code are not installed by default because
the DMD control code relies on the Windows specific [pywinusb](https://pypi.org/project/pywinusb/). To install these dependencies run
```
git clone https://github.com/QI2lab/mcSIM.git
cd mcSIM
pip install .[expt_ctrl]
```
Some functions can be optionally run on a GPU. If this is desired, ensure your python environment
has the appropriate version of [CuPy](https://cupy.dev/) installed

# SIM reconstruction code
### [sim_reconstruction.py](mcsim/analysis/sim_reconstruction.py)
Code for reconstructing SIM images from raw data using a Gustafsson/Wiener filter style reconstruction. Several
reconstruction options are available, largely following either the approach of
[openSIM](https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2016.2521542) or [fairSIM](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10980).
To get started with reconstructing SIM data, see the example script [reconstruct_sim.py](examples/reconstruct_sim_experiment.py). 

# DMD simulation code
### [simulate_dmd.py](mcsim/analysis/simulate_dmd.py)
Code for simulating the diffraction patterns produced by the DMD. Various 
scripts illustrating the usage of this code can be found in the [examples](examples)
directory. This simulation code has many useful features, including an analytic solution
for the joint blaze/diffraction condition, pattern simulation tools, tools for extracting the intensity pattern
in the Fourier plane of a collecting lens, etc.

### [dmd_patterns.py](mcsim/analysis/dmd_patterns.py)
This file can be used to generate multicolor SIM patterns and other useful calibrations
patterns for the DMD. It also contains many tools for working with the basis vector/unit cell
representation of DMD patterns. This allows a complete enumeration of DMD diffraction orders
in a compact and computationally efficient form.

# Utility code
### [fit_dmd_affine.py](mcsim/analysis/fit_dmd_affine.py)
Code to fit the affine transformation between the DMD coordinates and camera coordinates
using imaging data from a DMD pattern consisting of many small points. These code relies
on tools for working with affine transformations found 
[here](https://github.com/QI2lab/localize-psf/blob/master/localize_psf/affine.py)

### [otf_tools.py](mcsim/analysis/otf_tools.py)
Code for extracting optical transfer function from measurement of the strength of various Fourier peaks for a given SIM DMD pattern.
 
### [psd.py](mcsim/analysis/psd.py)
Code for doing the periodic/smooth image decomposition, an alternative to apodization for the Fourier transform.
This code is taken from https://github.com/jacobkimmel/ps_decomp (with permission), and included here for convenience.

### [analysis_tools.py](mcsim/analysis/analysis_tools.py)
Miscellaneous image processing tools, primarily for working with Fourier transforms

### [mm_io.py](mcsim/analysis/mm_io.py)
Tools for IO of MicroManager style tif files and metadata. 

### [localize-psf](https://github.com/QI2lab/localize-psf/blob/master/localize_psf)
Useful tools for automatically localizing sparse fluorescent beads and performing both 2D and 3D
PSF fitting using various PSF models. Also provides useful statistics and figures summarizing the results.
This code has now been split out into a [separate repository](https://github.com/QI2lab/localize-psf).
For more information about these tools, see the [readme](analysis/localize-psf/README.md)
pip installing the mcsim repository as described above will also pull in these dependencies.

# Examples
Scripts illustrated examples of different DMD simulations and analysis are stored in [examples](examples). Associated 
data is located in [examples/data](examples/data)
  
# Hardware control code
Hardware control is based around [MicroManager2.0](https://micro-manager.org/). Currently, we control the instrument
using a fork of the [napari-micromanager](https://github.com/QI2lab/napari-micromanager) project which controls
the MicroManager core using [pymmcore-plus](https://github.com/tlambert03/pymmcore-plus). Our fork of this project
relies on MicroManager device drives to control cameras and stages, and on python code to control the DMD and DAQ.
The "device adapters" for the DMD and DAQ are found below

### [expt_ctrl/dlp6500.py](mcsim/expt_ctrl/dlp6500.py)
Code for controlling the DLP6500 DMD over USB on Windows. This code was initially based on the approaches 
of [Lightcrafter6500DMDControl](https://github.com/mazurenko/Lightcrafter6500DMDControl) and
[Pycrafter6500](https://github.com/csi-dcsc/Pycrafter6500). Extension to other operating systems has not been
implemented but should be straightforward.

This file also includes functions used to define pattern sequences on the DMD using patterns have either been 
previously loaded onto the firmware using the [Texas Instruments DLP6500 and DLP9000
GUI](https://www.ti.com/tool/DLPC900REF-SW) or which are loaded "on-the-fly". There is a low-level interface
for running these patterns based directly on their index in the firmware. There is also a higher-level interface
which supports defining "channels" and "modes" which can be saved in a json configuration file.

When run as a script, this file provides a command line interface to programming DMD pattern sequences.

### [expt_ctrl/daq.py](mcsim/expt_ctrl/daq.py)
Code for controlling a national instruments DAQ through [PyDAQmx](https://pypi.org/project/PyDAQmx/)

### [expt_ctrl/daq_config.json](mcsim/expt_ctrl/daq_config.json)
DAQ configuration file describing "modes" and "channels" for the DAQ. This file is used by `nidaq` instances created
with [daq.py](mcsim/expt_ctrl/daq.py)

### [program_sim_odt.py](mcsim/expt_ctrl/program_sim_odt.py)
This file is used to create DAQ sequences for SIM and ODT experiments

### expt_ctrl/*.cfg
[MicroManager configuration files](https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide#Configuration_file_syntax)
describing the equipment and settings used in the experiment. 

### useful script files
Example scripts which are useful for controlling various instruments during testing include
[load_dmd_pattern.py](mcsim/expt_ctrl/load_dmd_pattern.py),
[setup_optotune_mre2.py](mcsim/expt_ctrl/setup_optotune_mre2.py), and
[set_dmd_odt_pattern.py](mcsim/expt_ctrl/set_dmd_odt_pattern.py)
